# Time_Series_Analysis_Zillow_Jacksonville

For this project, I am looking at zillow house sales price data for **Jacksonville, FL** from January 2000 to July 2023 to do a **time series analysis**. The data was gathered from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/. I will first collect the data for Jacksonville from all the counties in USA and then clean it. The aim of the project is to **identify the 5 zip codes that are going to see the most increase in sale prices** in the next three years. I will model the prices using ARIMA and use that to predict the future prices. 

For the exploratory data analysis, I have plotted the Number of cities in Jacksonville Metropolitan Area and number of zipcodes in them. I have also plotted the number of zip codes in each city that fit the budget constraint in between 250K and 300K. I have also shown price change as a function of year since 2000. We will see that **zip code 32219 is expected to grow the most in Jacksonville by 34.03%.**

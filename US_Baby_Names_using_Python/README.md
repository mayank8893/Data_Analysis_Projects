# US_Baby_Names_using_Python

For this project I have explored the dataset from US SSA which contains information about all the baby names from 1880 to 2022. This was an exploratory data analysis and some of the key fidings were:

1) Baby girls born each year were higher than baby boys from 1980 till 1933, at which point more baby boys started getting born and dominate till 2022.
2) I have plotted the most popular baby names for year 1880, 1919(after world war I), 1946(after world war II), 1971, 2000(turn of century) and 2016.
3) I have analyzed the popularity of four names: John, Mary, Marilyn and Harry year over year.
4) I found that the number of names it takes to get to 50% of names has increased dramatically. This implies that people are naming their kids more diverse names.
5) I also found that boy names ending in 'n' have experienced a significant growth and plotted ending letters d, n and y as a function of time.
6) Finally, I found that some names like Leslie were predominantly Male names till 1940s and since then they have become Female names.

A few of my python projects.

1) The first Python project here is analyzing four decades of movie data. The data set was downloaded from kaggle. 
I performed a bunch of cleaning operations to drop duplicates and figure out what percentage of values were missing in each column. 
After that I wanted to find out what were the parameters that contributed the most to gross revenue. To do this I generated correlation matrices and visualized them using seaborn and matplotlib and found that budget of the movie and number of votes received by it were highly correlated to the gross revenue of the movie. Please see the Movie_Correlation_Project-3.ipynb for the Jupyter notebook.

2) The second project here is to generate a few plots in MatPlotLib. I start with generating squares of first few natural number and using a scatterplot with colormap to plot them. I then move onto to declaring a class that generates a "random walk" with a set number of points, I then use a scatterplot with colormap and both the starting and ending positions to show the path taken. I then model what an actual "brownian motion" would look like. Finally, I create a class that models a die with any number of sides and then plot frequency of a number occuring in a few trials. I show what this would look like for sum of rolling two 6 sided die, product of rolling two 6 sided die, sum of rolling two dies(one six sided and one 10 sided) and a multitude of other combinations. This project is to show that I am proficient to generate some very basic level plots using MatPlotLib and Pygal. Please see: MatPlotLib_ch15.ipynb for explicit code and plots.

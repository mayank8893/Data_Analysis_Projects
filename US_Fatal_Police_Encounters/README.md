# US_Fatal_Police_Encounters

In this project, I am looking at the dataset from Kaggle on Fatal US Police encounters. I will first clean the data and then answer a few questions:

1. What is the distribution of Fatal encounters with respect to age, gender, mental illness and race? 
2. Are black people disproportionately killed?
3. Where are shootings happening?
4. Are Police Shooting deaths increasing?
5. Fatal Police encounters year over year for each race.
6. Exploratory analysis on other factors of fatal encounters.
7. City distribution of fatal encounters.
8. Race distribution of deaths inside these top cities.

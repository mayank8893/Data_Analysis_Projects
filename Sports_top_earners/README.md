# Sports_top_earners

Forbes publishes a list of top earning athletes each year. I have looked at the dataset from 1990 to 2020 and derived insights from the data. In particular, I have answered questions like:

1. Who were the world's highest paid athletes in 2020?
2. A list of top highest paid athlete for each year from 1990 to 2020 and their earnings.
3. Which athletes were among the list for most years?
4. Countries which produced the highest paid athletes.
5. How much did the top paid athlete earn year over year?
6. Which sports produced the top earners?
7. Which athletes appeared the most number of times in the list?
8. Women in the list?
9. Analysis of top three earners of all time.

# Stock_Data_Analysis

In this project, I have explored time series data of technology stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Tesla and Nvidia. I have used **yfinance** to get stock information, visualized it using **seaborn and matplotlib**. I have answered questions like:

1. What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2. What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3. What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4. What was the correlation between different stocks'?
5. How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6. How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing stock price of AAPL.)
